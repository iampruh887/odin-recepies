    <h3><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>brown sugar</li>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>

        <li>whole milk</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3><b>STEPS:</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the butterscotch base: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and brown sugar together, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture becomes fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and vanilla extract: Whisk in the milk and vanilla extract, and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Temper the egg yolks (if using): In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly whisk in a small amount of the hot butterscotch mixture to the egg yolks to temper them. Gradually whisk the tempered egg yolks into the remaining hot butterscotch mixture.</li>
        <li>Thicken the base (if using): In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with a tablespoon of the cold milk. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the hot butterscotch mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened.</li>
        <li>Chill the base: Remove the base from the heat and let it cool completely. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Churn the ice cream: Churn the chilled base in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Fold in mix-ins (if using): Once the ice cream is churned, fold in any desired mix-ins, such as chopped nuts or butterscotch chips.</li>
        <li>Freeze: Freeze the ice cream for at least 4 hours, or until firm.</li>
