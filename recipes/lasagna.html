    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is both delicious and comforting. It is made with layers of flat, wide pasta noodles, alternating with fillings of meat sauce, béchamel sauce (white sauce), vegetables, and cheese. The lasagna is then baked until the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
