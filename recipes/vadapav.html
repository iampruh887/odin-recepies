        The heart of the show is a golden-fried fritter made with mashed potatoes, onions, spices like turmeric and asafoetida. Sometimes, green chillies add a bit of heat. The batter often uses chickpea flour (besan) for a crispy golden crust.

    <h3><b>STEPS:</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Batata Vada: In a large bowl, mix together mashed potatoes, onion, green chili, ginger, turmeric, red chili powder (optional), coriander powder, garam masala, hing, salt, and coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into small balls, pressing them gently to flatten them slightly.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk besan with water to make a thick batter. Dip each vada ball in the batter, coating it evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat. Fry the vada balls until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Make the Chutneys: For the green chutney, grind together coriander leaves, mint leaves, green chilies, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, and salt. Adjust the consistency with water if needed.</li>
        <li>For the sweet chutney, soak tamarind pulp in warm water for 10 minutes. Strain the pulp and discard the seeds. In a pan, heat oil and add cumin seeds. Once they crackle, add the tamarind pulp, jaggery/brown sugar, red chili powder, hing, and salt. Cook until the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Vada Pav: Slit open a pav and spread both green and sweet chutneys on the inside. Place a hot batata vada inside the pav, and top with dry garlic chutney, fried green chili, and chopped onion (optional).</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade vada pav!</li>
